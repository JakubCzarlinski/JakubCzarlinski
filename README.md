Worked with Go, Python, Java, Haskell, C, VB.Net, C#, a little bit of C++ and Lua alike. I have a fair bit of experience using DirectX9 - it is slightly dated, but I made a 3D tank game as a project. Recently used a lottt of Apache Beam, super cool stuff - also really interested in ML. 

Currently working on teaching the Nybble Robot to walk using RL.  https://github.com/Vedal987/nybble-gym/
