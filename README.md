- 👋 Hi, I’m @JakubCzarlinski
- 👀 I’m interested in artificial intelligence, specifically reinforcement learning. I am very much still learning my way around RL. I'm currently working through an RL course on Coursera as well as few tutorials on YouTube.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about actor critic models.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any cool RL related projects that you have!
- 📫 How to reach me: DM me on discord @chadlinski#6049.
