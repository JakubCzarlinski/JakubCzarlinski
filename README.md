- 👋 Hi, I’m @JakubCzarlinski
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, more specifically reinforcement learning. I am very much still learning my way around RL.  Currently working through a RL course on Coursera as well as few tutorials here and there. In the past I have worked with Python, Java, VB.Net, C#, C, a little bit of C++ and Lua alike. I have a fair bit of experience using DirectX9 - it is slightly dated, but I made a fully functioning 3D tank game as a project.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on RL project that learns to trade Etheruem.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any cool RL related projects that you have!
- 📫 How to reach me: DM me on discord @chadlinski#6049.
