- 👋 Hi, I’m @JakubCzarlinski
- 👀 Worked with Python, Java, VB.Net, C#, C, a little bit of C++ and Lua alike. I have a fair bit of experience using DirectX9 - it is slightly dated, but I made a 3D tank game as a project.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on RL project that learns to trade Etheruem.
- 📫 How to reach me: discord @chadlinski#6049.
